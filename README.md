The Peptide Hit Results Processor can be used to convert an X!Tandem results file (XML format) or a SEQUEST Synopsis/First Hits file to a series of tab-delimited text files summarizing the results. The program also supports MSGF+ (aka MS-GFDB). When parsing X!Tandem data, the program will insert modification symbols into the peptide sequences for modified peptides. Parallel files are created containing sequence information, modification details, and protein information. The user can optionally provide a modification definition file that specifies the symbol to use for each modification mass.
