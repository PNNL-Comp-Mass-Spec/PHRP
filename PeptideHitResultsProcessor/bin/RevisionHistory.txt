	- The MH column in Inspect _syn.txt and _fht.txt files is now (M+H)+ instead of uncharged monoisotopic mass

Version 1.4.4239; August 10, 2011
	- Updated to Visual Studio 2010
	- Changed parameter MiscParams in IPeptideHitResultsProcessor to type System.Collections.Generic.List(Of String)

Version 1.3.3855; July 22, 2010
	- Removed dependence on AnalysisManagerProg.exe
	- Added new events and properties to interface IPeptideHitResultsProcessor

Version 1.3.3597; November 6, 2009
	- Updated to allow for peptides that start with ".." or end with ".."

Version 1.3.3561; October 1, 2009

	- No longer uses PRISM.Dll

Version 1.2.3413; May 6, 2009
	- Now storing 0 for DeltaNormMQScore if MQScore is 0 (previously was storing 100)

Version 1.2.3295; January 8, 2009
	- Now computing and storing MH in Inspect Syn and FHT files
		- The MH value is the peptide's theoretical monoisotopic mass value converted to MH (by adding a proton, 1.00727649 Da)
	- Now storing DeltaMass as negative the PrecursorError value computed by Inspect
		- This is done to be consistent with Sequest and XTandem, where the synopsis files list DeltaMass as Theoretical Mass - Observed Mass

Version 1.2.3294; January 7, 2009
	- Added support for Inspect results files with 22 columns (added PrecursorMZ and PrecursorError)
	- Added additional debug logic to clsAnalysisManagerPeptideHitResultsProcessor.vb

Version 1.2.3265; December 9, 2008
	- Improved support for N-terminal and C-terminal Inspect modifications
		- Now requiring that N-terminal modifications actually be at the N-terminus of the peptide
		- Now requiring that C-terminal modifications actually be at the C-terminus

Version 1.2.3264; December 8, 2008
	- Added support for Inspect modifications starting with a plus sign followed by the modification mass
		- For example: S.SPATLNSR+14.V
		- These are typically used for N-terminal and C-terminal mods
		- If found, then the mass value is compared to the mass values of the known mods; if a match is found within 0.5 Da, then the plus sign and number are replaced with the mod symbol

Version 1.2.3261; December 5, 2008
	- Now raising an error if the Inspect parameter file cannot be found
	- Added event ErrorOccured to clsPHRPBaseClass
	- clsAnalysisManagerPeptideHitResultsProcessor is now logging any errors raised by clsPHRPBaseClass

Version 1.2.3257; December 1, 2008
	- Fixed bug that included an extra tab at the end of the header line in Inspect First Hits and Synopsis files

Version 1.2.3219; October 24, 2008
	- Updated to compute DeltaNormMQScore and DeltaNormTotalPRMScore for Inspect (these values are similar to DelCn2 for Sequest)
		- The new values are written to the First Hits and Synopsis files
	- Added column MH to the Synopsis and First Hits files
		- At present, displaying a value of 0 for MH since Inspect doesn't report MH and computing it can be tricky
	- Now truncating extranneous zeroes from FractionY, FractionB, and PValue values
		- For example, 0.750 becomes 0.75 and 0.400 becomes 0.4

Version 1.2.3212; October 17, 2008
	- When processing Inspect results, now converting peptide length and NTT values to integers (e.g., Inspect writes out 2.000 instead of 2)

Version 1.2.3202; October 7, 2008
	- Now computing RankTotalPRMScore and RankFScore and writing to the _inspect_syn.txt and _inspect_fht.txt files
	- Now creating an additional FHT file, where the top match for each scan is chosen using FScore instead of TotalPRMScore
	- Updated to work with additional Inspect mod types: static, cterminal peptide, and nterminal peptide
	- Renamed inspect peptide to protein map file to end in _inspect_PepToProtMap.txt
	- Altered the filters for including a search result in the _inspect_syn.txt file
		- Including data that has pValue <= 0.2 Or TotalPRMScore >= 50 Or FScore >= 0

Version 1.2.3199; October 4, 2008
	- Converted solution to VB .NET 2008
	- Added support for Inspect results files

Version 1.1.3006; March 25, 2008
	- Added support for scan numbers specified by "MyDataset.300.300.2.dta" where "300" is the scan number

Version 1.1.2664; April 18, 2007
	- Added support for scan numbers specified by "scan 1234" instead of "scan=1234" in the "description" note of the "fragment ion mass spectrum" element 
	- Now looking for the text ":reversed" in the protein description, in addition to the protein label; if found, the protein name will end in :reversed

Version 1.1.2494; October 30, 2006
	- Moved function ExtractCleanSequenceFromSequenceWithMods from clsSearchResultsBaseClass.vb to clsPeptideCleavageStateCalculator.vb

Version 1.1.2412; August 9, 2006
	- Updated the ComputeSequenceMass() function in clsPeptideMassCalculator to allow input sequences to not contain prefix or suffix residues
	- Minor updates to the ResetProgress function

Version 1.1.2364; June 26, 2006
	- No longer saving negative numbers in the _ModDetails.txt file or _SeqInfo.txt file for Peptide and Protein terminus static modifications
		- We have decided that it is no longer useful to track static terminus modifications using negative numbers to signify the static terminus modification type, particularly since XTandem allows dynamic or static terminus mods

Version 1.1.2322; May 11, 2006
	- Updated the routine that parses out the scan number from the "description" note of the "fragment ion mass spectrum" element to look for the first number present if "scan=" is not present

Version 1.1.2256; March 6, 2006
	- Updated modification definition parsing routines to group modifications with the same modification mass (within 3 digits of precision) together
		- For example, if both D and E are listed on separate lines of the _ModDefs.txt file with a modification mass of 14.0157, then they will both be assigned the same modification symbol and their stats will be grouped together in the _ModSummary.txt file

Version 1.1.2249; February 27, 2006
	- Updated the default mass correction tag list

Version 1.1.2245; February 23, 2006
	- Fixed bug that failed to label reversed sequence proteins with the ":reverse" tag in the _SeqToProteinMap.txt file
	- Now auto-updating static modifications to be dynamic modifications if "refine, modification mass" is not blank (it is typically set to "none" if defined)
	- Switched to case-insensitive matching of entries in the <group label="input parameters" type="parameters"> section of  the XTandem results file

Version 1.1.2237; February 15, 2006
	- Now creating file _ResultToSeqMap.txt 
		- Links search result to Unique Sequence ID (used for both Sequest and XTandem results)
	- Now creating file _SeqToProteinMap.txt
		- Links Unique Sequence ID to protein name
		- Also lists Cleavage_State, Terminus_State, Protein_Expectation_Value_Log(e), and Protein_Intensity_Log(I)
		- The _SeqInfo.txt file no longer contains cleavage state and terminus state information
	- Updated the parsing of Sequest Synopsis files to keep track of the first observation of a given peptide for a given XCorr in a given scan
		- Only writing an entry to the _ResultToSeqMap.txt file for the first observation, but writing each protein found to the _SeqToProteinMap.txt file
	- Updated the parsing of the XTandem results to write out all unique peptide sequences identified for a given scan (aka given group)
		- Previously, was only saving the first peptide observed
	- Updated the parsing of the XTandem results to track all of the proteins associated with each peptide observation
		- Previously, was only saving the first protein listed for each peptide
	- For XTandem results, the _xt.txt file no longer lists the protein name, protein expectation value, or protein intensity
	- For XTandem results, the _xt.txt file now includes the Multiple_Protein_Count value for each search result (0 if the peptide is in one protein, 1 if in two proteins, etc.)
	- Updated the _xt.txt file to include a sequentially numbered Result_ID column prior to the Group_ID column
		- Necessary since a given group can have multiple, unique peptide sequences if the sequences all have the same hyperscore value
		- The Result_ID value can be used to associate the _ResultToSeqMap.txt file to the _xt.txt file
	- Updated the _xt.txt file to display the base-10 log of the peptide expectation value rather than the raw peptide expectation value

Version 1.0.2207; January 16, 2006
	- Initial stable release version
	- Supports XTandem _xt.txt files and Sequest _syn.txt and _fht.txt files
