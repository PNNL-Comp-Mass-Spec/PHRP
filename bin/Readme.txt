The Peptide Hit Results Processor can be used to convert an XTandem results file (XML format) or a Sequest Synopsis/First Hits file to a series of tab-delimited text files summarizing the results. When parsing XTandem data, the program will insert modification symbols into the peptide sequences for modified peptides. Parallel files are created containing sequence information, modification details, and protein information.  The user can optionally provide a modification definition file that specifies the symbol to use for each modification mass.
