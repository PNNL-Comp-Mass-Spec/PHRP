Peptide Hit Results Processor Revision History

Version 1.2.3199; October 4, 2008
	- Expanded support for Inspect results files
		- Now reads the parameter file provided to Inspect so that the modification names and masses can be determined
		- Now reads the _PeptideToProteinMapping.txt file so that the PHRP files can include all of the proteins for each peptide

Version 1.2.3191; September 26, 2008
	- Converted solution to VB .NET 2008
	- Added support for Inspect results files

Version 1.1.3006; March 25, 2008
	- Updates to PeptideHitResultsProcessor.dll:
		- Added support for scan numbers specified by "MyDataset.300.300.2.dta" where "300" is the scan number

Version 1.1.2991; March 10, 2008
	- Removed SharedVBNetRoutines.dll

Version 1.1.2673; April 27, 2007
	- Updates to PeptideHitResultsProcessor.dll:
		- Added support for scan numbers specified by "scan 1234" instead of "scan=1234" in the "description" note of the "fragment ion mass spectrum" element 
		- Now looking for the text ":reversed" in the protein description, in addition to the protein label; if found, the protein name will end in :reversed

Version 1.1.2494; October 30, 2006
	- Updated to inform user when unable to auto-determine the format of the input file

Version 1.1.2364; June 26, 2006
	- No longer saving negative numbers in the _ModDetails.txt file or _SeqInfo.txt file for Peptide and Protein terminus static modifications

Version 1.1.2322; May 11, 2006
	- Updated the routine that parses out the scan number from the "description" note of the "fragment ion mass spectrum" element to look for the first number present if "scan=" is not present

Version 1.1.2256; March 6, 2006
	- Updated modification definition parsing routines to group modifications with the same modification mass together

Version 1.1.2249; February 27, 2006
	- Updated the default mass correction tag list

Version 1.1.2245; February 23, 2006
	- Fixed bug that failed to label reversed sequence proteins with the ":reverse" tag in the _SeqToProteinMap.txt file

Version 1.1.2244; February 22, 2006
	- Now updating static XTandem mods to dynamic XTandem mods if a dynamic mod with an identical mass is found or if the directive <note type="input" label="refine, modification mass">none</note> is present in the XTandem parameters

Version 1.1.2237; February 15, 2006
	- Updated to new version of PeptideHitResultsProcessor.dll
		- The _SeqInfo.txt file no longer contains cleavage state and terminus state information
		- The new version now creates files _ResultToSeqMap.txt and _SeqToProteinMap.txt in addition to _SeqInfo.txt and _ModDetails.txt
		- The _xt.txt file no longer contains the protein name, protein expectation value, or protein intensity
		- The _xt.txt file now includes the Multiple_Protein_Count value for each search result (0 if the peptide is in one protein, 1 if in two proteins, etc.)

Version 1.0.2207; January 16, 2006
	- Initial stable release version
	- Supports XTandem _xt.txt files and Sequest _syn.txt and _fht.txt files
